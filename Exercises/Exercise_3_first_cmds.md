# Ex. 3 - Some important commands

In this exercise we will look a handful of used Linux commands.
 Here is a nice cheat sheet that sums up the usage of some of them: [Dave Child cheat sheet. ](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/)

 First remember the UNIX philosophy:
 - Programs do one thing and they do it well.
 - They work together.
 - And they should handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

A common feature of many Linux commands is the possibility of providing a switch (often called option, or flag) that modifies the behaviour of the command. You have already seen some of the possible modifications available for the listing commnad.

In the following exercises will look at:   
```scp``` - Secure copying of files and directories  
```rsync``` - Synchronise and transfer files and directories  
```rm``` - Remove files and directories
```less``` - Print content of file to screen  
```more``` - Print content of file to   
```head``` - Print the head of file(s)  
```tail``` - Print the end (tail) of file(s)  
```cat``` - Print and concatenate several files  
```grep``` - Search through text files  
```sort``` - Sort the content of files  
```uniq``` - Print unique (lines, or words)
